# To-Do List Full Stack App

A Simple ToDo App is built using the MVC Architecture, we have also implemented "authorization" so folx can sign up, customize & personalize the app

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Bootstrap
**Packages/Dependencies used:** bcrypt, connect-mongo, dotenv, ejs, express, express-flash, express-session, mongodb, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local, validator

For this I used Mongoose with my model to make a schema for MongoDB, used EJS for my views folder, created utilized passport to store user information and validator to check if users are logged in and to prevent them from just typing in the page route and bypassing having an account. 

## Optimizations

The CSS needs the most work. Ideally if I had more time to work on this project I'd utilize REACT to place more emphasis on the stylistic aspect of the app.

## Lessons Learned:

This project taught me a lot about utilizing a MVC framework when building my project and made me more comfortable with utilizing passport.js.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple of projects I've worked on:
